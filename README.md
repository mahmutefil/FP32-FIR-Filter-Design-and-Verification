# FP32-FIR-Filter-Design-and-Verification
In the repository, the design and verification of a Floating-Point Single Precision (32-bits) FIR Filter realization can be found. The design is created using VHDL and veification part is realized using both VHDL and Systemverilog. The design is applicable for INTEL ALTERA FPGAs. The Software used to implement the FIR Filter is Quartus Prime Lite 18.0 and QuestaSim Software 2021.1.
