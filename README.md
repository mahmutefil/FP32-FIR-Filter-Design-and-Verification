# FP32-FIR-Filter-Design-and-Verification
In the repository, the design and verification of a parallel Floating-Point Single Precision (32-bits) FIR Filter realization can be found. The design is created using VHDL and veification part is realized using both VHDL and Systemverilog. The design is applicable for INTEL ALTERA FPGAs. The Software used to implement the FIR Filter is Quartus Prime Lite 18.0 and QuestaSim Software 2021.1.

In this project, the Floating-point operation in ALTERA is performed by configuring IPs which are ALTFP_MUL and ALTFP_ADD_SUB found in ALTERA library. Since the interfacing of the IP is register based, the design is arranged to operate with desired interfacing. 
Basically, there is a design architecture that fetches the filter order and the number of FP IPs to be able to parallelize the architecture to be able to select the most suitable numbers in terms of resource usage, timing and latency. The user can determine these generic values according to the design needs.  As seen in Figure X, the number of FP IPs is used to perform Fused Multiply-Add operation that includes one ALTFP_MULT IP and one ALTFP_ADD IP. At the end, single FP Addition IP is used to add the accumulated results coming from the above part.
